# Ashy-Sandbox

This will be my sandbox GitHub repo.

I have used Git at work, but have not utilized GitHub. I plan to hopefully use it more.

## Why was this created?

The repo was created to help me get more familar with the GitHub interface and play around with branching, pulling, merging, merge conflicts, pushings, etc. I wanted to keep my hello-world repo relatively simple as well.

I also might play a little with markdown here
