# ashy-sandbox

This will be my sandbox GitHub repo, where I can play around with GitHub.

## why was this created?

I have used Git at work, but have not utilized GitHub. I plan to hopefully use it more.

The repo was created to help me get more familar with the GitHub interface and play around with branching, pulling, merging, merge conflicts, pushings, etc. I wanted to keep my hello-world repo relatively simple as well.

I also might play a little with markdown here

## who?

My name is Ash Shih. I am into data related things (Data Visualization and Data Science in particular). I am trying to have more presence online, so hopefully particpating on GitHub helps. I am typically introverted and am scared to share/contribute to online communities, such as GitHub.
